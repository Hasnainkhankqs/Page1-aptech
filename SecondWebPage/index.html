                <h2 id="h2">New polymer patch can repair heart damage </h2>
                <p>MELBOURNE: A new flexible polymer patch can improve the conduction of electrical impulses across damaged heart tissue without the need for stitches, scientists say.
                The patch, which has been shown to work in animal models, is long lasting and has the significant advantage that it can be stuck onto the heart without the need for stitches.
                "Heart attacks create a scar which slows and disrupts the conduction of electrical impulses across the heart," said Professor Sian Harding from Imperial College London.</p>

                <h2 id="h2">Hologram </h2>
                <p>The development of holographic technology commenced back in the 1940’s when a Hungarian-British physicist named Dennis Gabor endeavoured to build on the field of X-ray microscopy.
                    The technique as it was originally invented is still used in electron microscopy. The form that we’re interested in, however – optical holography – didn’t really propel itself onto the main stage until the development of the laser in the 60s.
                    That’s how holograms work if you didn’t know: lasers. Holograms use laser lights to illuminate the subject, which is then imprinted on a recording medium. The reason lasers are needed is because they have a fixed wavelength, like a defined vector; light from other sources aren’t so effectively regulated and so can’t focus tight enough to define a 3D image.
                    One of the more interesting ways in which holographic technology has been used is in the form of art. Artists have been, along with scientists, some of the first to capitalise on this wave of rather incredible technological progress.
                    The master of surrealism Salvador Dali was hailed as one of the first artists to use holographic technology as an art form in his collaboration with Alice Cooper back in the 70s. The truth, however, is that there was an exhibition of holographic art at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, 1968, preceding Dali’s famous work by a few years.

                <h2 id="h2">INVISIBLE CLOAK </h2>
                <p>Researchers have constructed an invisibility cloak capable of hiding a tiny object by altering the behavior of the light that hits it. This is the first invisibility cloak made out of sophisticated, artificial materials called metamaterials that work for the full spectrum of light visible to the human eye.
                    The cloak the researchers constructed and tested could disguise a miniscule object, 0.000024 inches wide by 0.000012 inches high (6 microns high by 300 nanometers wide) — roughly the size of a red blood cell or 100 times thinner than a human hair, according to study researcher Majid Gharghi, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.
                    Until now, metamaterial cloaks such as this one have only hidden objects from limited parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, outside the range of what we can see or for only part of the visible range. And another type of device, made of calcite crystal prisms, has been used to hide things in white, or full-spectrum, light, but only if wavelengths of that light are traveling at a particular angle, or are properly polarized.

                <h2 id="h2">robots powered by living muscle tissue or cells </h2>
                <p>Think of a traditional robot and you probably imagine something made from metal and plastic. Such "nuts-and-bolts" robots are made of hard materials. As robots take on more roles beyond the lab, such rigid systems can present safety risks to the people they interact with. For example, if an industrial robot swings into a person, there is the risk of bruises or bone damage.
                    Researchers are increasingly looking for solutions to make robots softer or more compliant — less like rigid machines, more like animals. With traditional actuators — such as motors — this can mean using air muscles or adding springs in parallel with motors. For example, on a Whegs robot, having a spring between a motor and the wheel leg (Wheg) means that if the robot runs into something (like a person), the spring absorbs some of the energy so the person isn't hurt. The bumper on a Roomba vacuuming robot is another example; it's spring-loaded so the Roomba doesn't damage the things it bumps into.
                    But there's a growing area of research that's taking a different approach. By combining robotics with tissue engineering, we're starting to build robots powered by living muscle tissue or cells. These devices can be stimulated electrically or with light to make the cells contract to bend their skeletons, causing the robot to swim or crawl. The resulting biobots can move around and are soft like animals. They're safer around people and typically less harmful to the environment they work in than a traditional robot might be. And since, like animals, they need nutrients to power their muscles, not batteries, biohybrid robots tend to be lighter too.

                <h2 id="h2">Shrinks when heated </h2>
                <p>It's one of the basic facts of science: Heat something and it expands. But a team of US scientists has gone counterintuitive and invented a 3D-printed material that shrinks when heated. Developed as part of DARPA's program to study materials with controlled microstructure architecture, the lightweight metamaterial exhibits what the researchers call "negative thermal expansion."
                Metamaterials are one of those things that come out of the lab with an air of enchantment about them. Basically, they're made up of composite materials, like metals, plastics, or ceramics, engineered into repeating, microscopic structures. Depending on how these structures are designed, they can give the metamaterial properties that aren't found in nature and may not even be derived from the source materials themselves.
                The study by a team from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) Additive Manufacturing Initiative in partnership with the University of Southern California, MIT, and the University of California, Los Angeles, used a 3D printing process called projection microstereolithograpy to form a polymer and a polymer/copper composite into a highly complex 3D bi-material microlattice structure. To put it more simply, they printed a material made of two substances to form a pattern by printing out the polymer in a layer, cleaning the surface to avoid contamination, then printing the polymer/copper composite, then repeating.

                <h2 id="h2">Cyborgs is reality </h2>
                <p>The U.S. military is spending millions on an advanced implant that would allow a human brain to communicate directly with computers.
                If it succeeds, cyborgs will be a reality.
                The Pentagon's research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), hopes the implant will allow humans to directly interface with computers, which could benefit people with aural and visual disabilities, such as veterans injured in combat.
                The goal of the proposed implant is to "open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics" according to DARPA's program manager, Phillip Alvelda.
                In January, DARPA announced it plans to spend up to $62 million on the project, which is part of its Neural Engineering System Design program.
                The implant would be small -- no larger than one cubic centimeter, or roughly the size of two stacked nickels -- according to DARPA.
                The implantable device aims to convert neurons in the brain into electronic signals and provide unprecedented "data-transfer bandwidth between the human brain and the digital world," according to a DARPA statement announcing the new project.
                DARPA sees the implant as providing a foundation for new therapies that could help people with deficits in sight or hearing by "feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain."
                A spokesman for DARPA told CNN that the program is not intended for military applications.

                <h2 id="h2">Teleportation </h2>
                <p>Quantum teleportation relies on a phenomenon called quantum entanglement, whereby some particles remain connected no matter how far apart they are.
                This means that should the state of one particle change, the other will be instantaneously affected through a transmission of information that's faster than the speed of light.
                As the particles communicate via entanglement, it would be next to impossible for an outside source to read the information encoded in them.
                To decrypt any message, a separately sent key is required which, even if intercepted, would require the person to also have possession of the entangled photons.
                In the Calgary experiment, Dr Wolfgang Tittel and his colleagues managed to teleport the quantum state of a photon over 8.2 kilometers.
